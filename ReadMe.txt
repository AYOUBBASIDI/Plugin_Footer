How to create a plugin ( Basics )

To create a plugin, all you need to do is create a folder and then create a single file with one line of content. Navigate to the wp-content/plugins folder,
and create a new folder named "exemple_plugin". Inside this new folder, create a file named "exemple_plugin.php". Open the file in a text editor, 
and paste the following information in it :

<?php
   /*
   Plugin Name: exemple_plugin
   Plugin URI: 
   description: a plugin to create ....
   Version: 1.0
   Author: Your Name
   Author URI: 
   License: 
   */
?>
